# PhonePe-Pulse
📌 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, which provides rich insights into digital transactions across India. The raw data has been cleaned, transformed, and visualized using tools such as Google Colab, Power BI, SQLite, and Python libraries like Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib ,Plotly.


🔍 Objectives:

1.To extract and preprocess raw JSON data from PhonePe Pulse.

2.To convert the data into structured formats (CSV and SQLite DB).

3.To build interactive visualizations that reveal insights about:

4.Transaction volumes by state and district

5.User growth and distribution

6.Insurance payment trends

7.Top-performing locations by transaction count/value


📦 Dataset Details:

The project uses the following cleaned CSV files:
1.aggregated_transaction.csv: State-wise transaction types and values

2.aggregated_user.csv: User registration and activity trends

3..csv: Insurance payment data across India

4.map_transaction.csv, map_user.csv, map_insurance.csv: Geo-mapped summaries

5.top_transaction.csv, top_user.csv, top_insurance.csv: Top 10 states/districts by category


📊 Tools Used:

1.Google Colab: Data analysis and transformation (in DataExtraction.ipynb)(Python)

2.Power BI: Visualization of insights (in PhonePe_Pulse.pbix)

3.SQLite: Database storage (phonepe_pulse.db)
